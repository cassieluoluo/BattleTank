    Select the "Barrel_Base" in the tank.
     

    And click the "Motion" in the "Reciol_Brake_CS(Script)".
     

    The curve editor will appear. Set up the Curve as following image.
    
    About how to edit the Curve, please refer to the following official manual.
    https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/EditingCurves.html
    

(2) Attach Semi-Automatic component if you need.
    Semi-Automatic operation method had been added in version 2.2.
    If you need it, attach the component into your tank.

    You can find the prefab "AI_Semi_Core" in the 'Template' folder.
    Drag and drop it into the MainBody of your tank in the Hierarchy window.
     

    And make sure that the "AI_Semi_Core" is place under the MainBody as its child.
     

    Next, select the top object of the tank, and change the "Input Device Type" to "Semi Automatic".
     

    Now, test yout tank in PlayMode.
    About the operation method, please read "How to operate".
     


(3) Adjust the "Engine_Sound" settings.
    When your tank has "Physics Track", you need to adjust the "Engine_Sound".
    Select the "Engine_Sound" in the tank.
     

    And set the "Track Type" according to the type of the track attached to this tank.
     


(4) Update the "CreateSteered_Wheel". 
    When your tank has "CreateSteered_Wheel" such as "Sdkfz251", press the "Update Value" button in it.
       


(5) Adjust AI Tank settings.
    The behavior of AI had been changed in version 2.2.
    The new AI uses both brake-turn and pivot-turn properly. So the tank requires enough braking force to turn a corner.
    When your AI tank cannot smoothly turn a corner, try the following steps.

    Select the MainBody in your AI tank.
     

    And increase the "Turn Brake Drag" value in the "Drive_Control_CS (script)".
     


    Also you can adjust the angle that the AI switches pivot-turn from brake-turn, and the speed rate while turning.
    Select the  "AI_Core" in the tank.
     

    And adjust the "Pivot Turn Angle" and "Min Speed Rate".
     
    [Pivot Turn Angle]
    The tank does pivot-turn (swivel turning) when the angle to the next corner is greater than this value.
    (Notice.)
    When your AI tank has trouble turning a tight corner, try to reduce this value.

    [Min Speed Rate]
    AI decreases the tank speed while turning by referring to this value.
    (Notice.)
    When your AI tank has trouble turning a tight corner, try to reduce this value.

    For more information about AI settings, please read "AI System".


(6) Adjust the "SwingBalls" settings.
    The behavior of "SwingBall" has been changed in version 2.3.
    Adjust the settings of the "Create_SwingBall" if you need.
    Please read "How to attach 'SwingBall'" and "Create_SwingBall".

(Warning.)
This AI system requires Navigation Mesh (NavMesh) in the scene.
When the NavMesh has not been baked for the scene, you will get errors in PlayMode.
In the sample scenes, the NavMeshes are already prepared. 


You can find finished AI tank prefabs in the "Resources" >> "Sample_Tank_##" >> "AI_##" folder.


(1) Drag and drop the prefab into the Hierarchy window.
    
(2) Select the top object of the tank in the Hierarchy window.

(3) Choose the "Tank ID" differing from other tanks in the Inspector window.
     
    (Notice.)
    At least one of the tanks must have ID [ 1 ] in the scene, otherwise you will get errors in PlayMode.


(4) Choose the "Relationship".
    Choose the relationship with other tanks.
     

(5) Set the "WayPoint Pack" fitting for the scene.
     
    Drag and drop the "WayPoint Pack" fitting for the scene.
    (Notice.)
    When the WayPoint Pack is not assigned, the AI tank tries to stay in its initial position.

    'WayPoint Pack' is a parent object that have some child objects as waypoints in the scnene.
     

(6) Adjust the position as you will.
    Make sure that the top object is selected, and move the position as you will.
    (Notice.)
    AI tank must be placed on NavMesh.
     

(7) Now you are ready to play.
    (Notice.)
    You can modify the AI settings much more.
    Please read also "Top object of tank" and "AI_System".

"FAQ" (Ver.2.3)

Q. "Physics Track" has broken at the opening.

A1. Use "Wheel Resize Script" option.
    When the wheels are too small, the track pieces often go through them at the opening.
    Select the "Create_###Wheel" and enable the "Wheel Resize Script" option. And set the "Scale Size" to greater than 1.
    When the wheels are too big and they protrude from the track, set the "Scale Size" to smaller than 1.
    The wheels are resized to the specified scale at the opening. And they return gently to the original size.
    
    

A2. Use "Soft_Landing" option.
    If the track has broken by falling to the ground at the opening, try to use "Soft_Landing" option.
    Select the "MainBody" and enable the "Soft Landing" option.
    The tank will quietly fall down and gently land on the ground.



Q. "Physics Track" is too loose while running.

A. Adjust the tension of the track.
    Please read "How to adjust the tension of 'Physics_Track'".



Q. Can I use other game pad?

A. Modify the "Input Manager".
    The "Input Manager" in this project is set for 'Xbox 360' controller.
    When you use other gamepad, you might have to modify your "Input Manager".
    Please refer to the following 'Wiki'.

Q. How to increase the tank speed?

A1. Increase the "Torque" and "Maximum Speed" values.
    Select the "MainBody", and increase the "Torque" and "Maximum Speed" values.
    When your tank has "Static Track" or "Scroll Track", the tank will get a high speed.

A2. Decrease the "Fixed Timestep" value.
    When your tank has "Physics Track", it is almost impossible to get more speed only by increasing the torque and the maximum speed values.
    Because the physics components in the tracks cannot work accurately while running fast in the default physics settings.
    You need also to adjust the "Fixed Timestep" value in the "Game_Controller" in the scene. Try to change the value to 0.01.
    The tank will get more speed, however please do not forget that the stress on the processor has much increased.

A3. Increase the "Time Scale" value.
    The speed of the time passing can be changed in "Game_Controller" in the scene.

A4. Convert the "Physics Track" into "Static Track".
    When your tank has "Physics Track", try to convert it to "Static Track".
    Please read "How to convert the 'Physics_Track' into 'Static_Track'.



Q. How to modify the bullet settings?

A. Modify the bullet settings in "Bullet_Generator".
    You can modify the bullet settings in "Bullet_Generator" in the tank.
    Please read "Bullet_Generator".



Q. How to change the reloading time?

A. Change "Reload Time" value in the "Cannon_Base".
    You can change the reloading time in "Cannon_Base" in the tank.
    Please read "Cannon_Base".



Q. AI tank ignores my new tank.

A. Set the "Upper Offset for AI" and "Lower Offset for AI".
    The height of your new tank should be different from the tank used as the base.
    Set the appropriate values into the "Upper Offset for AI" and "Lower Offset for AI" in the "MainBody" of your new tank.
    Please read "MainBody".
